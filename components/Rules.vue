    As an MtG player, I have mostly 20-sided dice so I adapted Liam's idea to 20 sides 
    and assigned a colored die to each category.  This results in all keys listed (heh heh).  
    I also made the tempos a bit more granular which I think makes it a little more 
    targeted towards certain feels/dances.  I will print this & tape it to the basement 
    fridge & hang a sac 'o dice next to it.  
    
    Holler if you have any edits, ideas,etc.  So, my friends, I present to you...
